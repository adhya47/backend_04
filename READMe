This project implements a secure authentication workflow using Node.js, JWT, and Redis.
The main highlight is the Redis-powered logout mechanism, where user tokens are stored in Redis with an expiry time to ensure they cannot be reused after logout.

📌 What I Learned

While building and improving the logout feature, I explored Redis in-depth, including:

✅ 1. Token Blacklisting using Redis

On logout, the user’s JWT token is stored inside Redis.

This prevents the token from being used again even if it is technically still valid.

Redis acts as a fast in-memory blacklist.

✅ 2. Setting Token Expiry in Redis

Each stored token in Redis is given a TTL (Time-to-Live) equal to the remaining validity of the JWT.

Once TTL expires, Redis automatically removes the token.

This ensures memory is optimized and old tokens are cleaned automatically.

✅ 3. Efficient Authentication Handling

Every protected route checks Redis before authenticating:

If the token exists in Redis → Access Denied

If not → verify JWT normally

This combines stateless JWT authentication with stateful security enhancement.

✅ 4. Deep Understanding of Redis Concepts

How to create Redis clients

How to manage keys and TTL

Understanding memory store vs persistence

Handling Redis connection issues and authentication
